Wanna do something else, or have a question not answered here? Hop into Slack and ask us questions before you get started. [Get an invite to SQLCommunity.slack.com](https://sqlps.io/slack/), and we're in the [#FirstResponderKit channel](https://sqlcommunity.slack.com/messages/firstresponderkit/). We welcome newcomers, and there's always a way you can help.

## How to Report Bugs or Request Enhancements

Check out the [Github issues list]. Search for what you're interested in - there may already be an issue for it. Make sure to search through closed issues, too, because we often decline things that aren't a good fit for these tools.

If you can't find a similar issue, go ahead and open your own. Include as much detail as you can - what you're seeing now, and what you'd like to see.

When requesting new checks, keep in mind that we want to focus on:

* Actionable warnings - SQL Server folks are usually overwhelmed with data, and we only want to report on things they can actually do something about
* Performance issues or reliability risks - if it's just a setting we don't agree with, let's set that aside
* Things that end users or managers will notice - if we're going to have someone change a setting on their system, we want it to be worth their time

Now head on over to the [Github issues list] and get started.

## How to Write New T-SQL Checks

Before you code, check the [Github issues list] for what you're trying to do - there may already be an issue for it. Make sure to search through closed issues, too, because we often decline things that aren't a good fit for these tools.

If you've got a new idea that isn't covered in an existing issue, open a Github issue for it. Outline what you'd like to do, and how you'd like to code it. This just helps make sure other users agree that it's a good idea to add to these tools.

After a discussion, to start coding, [open a new Github branch.](https://www.brentozar.com/archive/2015/07/pull-request-101-for-dbas-using-github/) This lets you code in your own area without impacting anyone else. When your code is ready, test it on a case-sensitive instance of the oldest supported version of SQL Server (2008), and the newest version (2016).

When it's ready for review, make a pull request, and one of the core contributors can check your work.

## How to Test Checks Written by Someone Else

(stub)

* Test only on case-sensitive instances. A surprising number of folks out there run on these.
* Test on as many currently-supported versions of SQL Server as possible. At minimum, test on the oldest version (currently 2008), and the newest version (currently 2016).
