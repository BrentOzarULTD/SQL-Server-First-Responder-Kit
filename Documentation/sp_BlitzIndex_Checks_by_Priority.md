# sp_BlitzIndex Checks by Priority

This table lists all checks ordered by priority. 

Before adding a new check, make sure to add a Github issue for it first, and have a group discussion about its priority, description, and findings URL.

If you want to change anything about a check - the priority, finding, URL, or ID - open a Github issue first. The relevant scripts have to be updated too.

CURRENT HIGH CHECKID: 121
If you want to add a new check, start at 122.
